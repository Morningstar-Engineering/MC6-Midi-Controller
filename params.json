We have changed it to execute chronologically along with other Midi Messages. This will allow you to take advantage of bank-specific messages and apply it to other banks. For example, from Bank 1, you can do a Set Bank to Bank 2, and then apply a Clear Toggle message to Bank 2.\r\n* Bank number of last Set Bank will print. However, you can jump to multiple banks in-between.\r\n\r\n__Clear Toggle (Should be renamed to \"Set Toggle\")__\r\n#### For Number 1 = 127 (All Presets)\r\n* Set Value 1 = 0- 63 to clear (Stop Blink)\r\n* Set Value 2 = 64 - 127 to engage (Blink)\r\n\r\n#### For individual toggle selection\r\n* Set Number 1 = 0 to clear (Stop Blink)\r\n* Set Number 1 = 1 to engage (Blink)\r\n* Set Value 1, Number 2 and Value 2 to be the presets you want to set.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n__Bug Fixes__\r\n* Fixed issue where toggle states are not saved after using the Set Bank function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Stable Release: v2.3\r\n\r\n__Midi Message Types__\r\n* Added SysEx Midi Type.\r\n  * Users can now create their own custom SysEx message to send out via DIN5 Midi and USB Midi.\r\n* Added Set Midi Thru Type\r\n  * Users can now control the MC6 Midi Thru and turn it ON or OFF in a preset.\r\n* Added Clear Toggle Type\r\n  * This type resets all toggle keys for all presets in the current active bank, which will allow you to use the bank as a \"Scene\" or \"Preset\" select.\r\n* Added Blink Midi Type\r\n  * Blink any preset by adding this Midi Type.\r\n* MC6 Bank up and Bank down\r\n  * Smoother bank changing using presets. No longer required to allow next bank to load before being able to change bank.\r\n* CC Message\r\n  * CC Continuous sending now enabled. Set N2 = 127 and V2 = 127 to continuously send CC#N1:V1 while switch is held down.\r\n* Set Bank\r\n  * Jump to a pre-determined bank, or bank to your previous bank.\r\n\r\n__Midi Editor Mode__\r\n* Toggle in and out of Midi Editor mode by pressing Switch [A + D] together, and then Switch [F]. Powering down and up is not required.\r\n* Removed function to enter Midi Editor mode, where the user holds Switch [A] before powering up.\r\n\r\n__DIN5-USB Mode__\r\n* Rename to \"Midi Thru\".\r\n* Toggle can be done by pressing Switch [A + D] together, and then Switch [C], or toggled from the Main Configuration menu.\r\n\r\n__Preset Manager__\r\n* Added implementation for the MC6 to work with the Morningstar Preset Manager to allow users to download and upload presets\r\n\r\n\r\n__Bug Fixes__\r\n* Midi Clock\r\n  * Fixed issue where BPM reads the switch twice if the switch is held down for too long and released\r\n* Factory Reset\r\n  * Fixed issue where MC6 will do a Factory Reset when Switches D + F are held down for too long. Configuration menu now only loads when switches are released, and the Reset function is changed from Switch D to Switch E to prevent the user from accidentally doing a Factory Reset.\r\n* Fixed usbMIDI thru bug\r\n\r\n__Minor Changes__\r\n* Renamed Midi Type \"SysEx RT\" to \"System RT\"\r\n",
